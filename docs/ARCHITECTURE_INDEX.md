# Zendesk AI Integration Architecture Documentation

This document serves as an index to the architecture documentation for the Zendesk AI Integration project. The project follows a Clean Architecture approach to ensure maintainability, testability, and flexibility.

## Architecture Decision Records

The following decisions were made during the refactoring to clean architecture:

1. **Domain-First Approach**: We defined all domain entities and interfaces before implementing infrastructure components to ensure proper separation of concerns.

2. **Use Case Pattern**: Application logic is organized into focused use cases that orchestrate domain objects and services.

3. **Dependency Injection**: All components receive their dependencies through constructor injection to improve testability and maintainability.

4. **Command Pattern for CLI**: The command-line interface uses the command pattern to encapsulate each operation in its own class.

5. **Repository Pattern**: Data access is abstracted through repositories that implement domain interfaces.

6. **Service Abstraction**: External services (AI, Zendesk) are abstracted behind interfaces defined in the domain layer.

7. **DTOs for Layer Communication**: Data Transfer Objects are used to communicate between layers without leaking domain objects.

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to this project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Place new code in the appropriate architectural layer
2. Respect the dependency rule (dependencies point inward only)
3. Define interfaces in the domain layer before implementing them
4. Inject dependencies rather than creating them directly
5. Write unit tests that validate your implementation
6. Update architecture documentation when adding significant components

## Getting Started with the Architecture

To understand how the clean architecture is implemented in this project:

1. Start by reviewing the [Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Examine the interfaces in the domain layer
3. Look at how use cases orchestrate the application logic
4. Review the implementation of repositories and services in the infrastructure layer
5. See how the presentation layer uses commands to interact with use cases

## Migration Status

All components have been successfully migrated to the clean architecture:

- ✅ Domain Layer
- ✅ Application Layer
- ✅ Infrastructure Layer
- ✅ Presentation Layer

The refactoring is now complete, with all components following clean architecture principles.
