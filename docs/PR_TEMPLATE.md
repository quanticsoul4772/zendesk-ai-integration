# AI API Mocking Implementation

## Problem

Integration tests were failing due to invalid OpenAI API credentials and lack of proper mocking.
Tests were attempting to make real API calls instead of using mock responses, resulting in:

- Authentication errors (`401 Unauthorized`)
- Inconsistent test results based on API availability
- Test failures when run in environments without API access

## Solution

1. Created comprehensive mocking for OpenAI API calls in integration tests:
   - Added an `autouse=True` fixture in `tests/integration/conftest.py` to automatically mock all OpenAI API calls
   - Implemented content-aware mock responses that return appropriate data based on the prompt content
   - Ensured mock responses match the expected structure for successful tests

2. Created a dedicated testing version of the sentiment analysis tests with explicit mocking
   - Added `tests/integration/test_sentiment_analysis_mock.py` with explicit mock handling
   - Parameterized test cases to verify different urgency levels

3. Added documentation for AI service mocking best practices
   - Created `docs/MOCKING_AI_SERVICES.md` with detailed instructions

## How to Test

1. Run the basic unit tests to verify they still pass:
   ```
   pytest tests/unit/test_ai_service.py -v
   ```

2. Run the new mocked integration tests:
   ```
   pytest tests/integration/test_sentiment_analysis_mock.py -v
   ```

3. Verify all tests pass without making any real API calls (you can check this by disabling your network connection)

4. Check the logs to confirm the mocked OpenAI calls are being used:
   ```
   pytest tests/integration/test_sentiment_analysis_mock.py -v --log-cli-level=INFO
   ```
   You should see log messages containing "Using mocked OpenAI API call"

## Future Improvements

1. Extend mocking to cover other AI services (Anthropic, etc.)
2. Add more specialized mock responses for edge cases
3. Consider implementing a mock response generator based on real API responses
4. Add more extensive testing for error handling scenarios

## Additional Notes

This implementation follows the project's existing patterns for mocking and testing, while adding
necessary functionality to make integration tests reliable. The fixture approach was chosen to
minimize changes needed to existing test files.
