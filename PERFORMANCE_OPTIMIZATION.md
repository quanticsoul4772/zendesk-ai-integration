## Caching System

The application uses a sophisticated caching system to reduce the number of API calls to Zendesk and improve response times.

### Key Features

- **TTL (Time-to-Live) Caching**: All cached data has a specified expiration time to ensure freshness
- **Threadsafe Implementation**: Thread-safe design allows concurrent access without race conditions
- **Separate Cache Stores**: Different data types (views, tickets, users) have their own cache with appropriate TTLs
- **Granular Cache Invalidation**: API provides methods to invalidate specific items or entire caches
- **Cache Statistics**: Methods for tracking cache usage and performance

### Cache TTL Values

| Data Type | Default TTL | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Views     | 15 minutes  | Zendesk views change infrequently |
| Tickets   | 5 minutes   | Tickets may be updated more frequently |
| Users     | 30 minutes  | User data changes infrequently |

### Usage Example

The caching system is automatically used by the ZendeskClient class. You don't need to manage it directly in most cases. However, here's how it works behind the scenes:

```python
# ZendeskClient will first check the cache
tickets = zendesk_client.fetch_tickets_from_view(view_id)

# To manually invalidate cache if needed
zendesk_client.cache.invalidate_tickets()  # Clear all ticket cache
zendesk_client.cache.invalidate_ticket(ticket_id)  # Clear specific ticket
zendesk_client.cache.clear_all()  # Clear all caches
```

## Batch Processing

The application uses parallel processing to analyze multiple tickets simultaneously, significantly improving performance for large datasets.

### Key Features

- **Thread Pool Execution**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel processing of I/O-bound operations
- **Configurable Thread Count**: Adjustable number of worker threads based on CPU cores and workload
- **Batch Size Control**: Process tickets in controlled batch sizes to manage memory usage
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar for monitoring batch operations
- **Robust Error Handling**: Individual item failures don't stop the entire batch process

### Performance Improvements

Batch processing provides significant performance improvements when analyzing multiple tickets:

| Tickets | Sequential Processing | Batch Processing | Improvement |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 10      | ~20 seconds          | ~5 seconds      | 4x faster   |
| 50      | ~100 seconds         | ~20 seconds     | 5x faster   |
| 100     | ~200 seconds         | ~35 seconds     | 5.7x faster |

*Note: Actual performance varies based on hardware, network conditions, and ticket complexity*

### Usage Example

Batch processing is automatically used by the application. The following command will use batch processing:

```bash
python src/zendesk_ai_app.py --mode run --view [VIEW_ID]
```

## Configuration Options

The batch processing and caching systems can be configured in the application code:

### Batch Processing Configuration

In `src/modules/ai_analyzer.py`:

```python
self.batch_processor = BatchProcessor(
    max_workers=5,  # Number of parallel threads
    batch_size=10,  # Number of tickets per batch
    show_progress=True  # Show progress bar
)
```

### Cache Configuration

In `src/modules/cache_manager.py`:

```python
# Cache for views data (15 minutes TTL)
self._views_cache = cachetools.TTLCache(maxsize=100, ttl=900)  

# Cache for tickets data (5 minutes TTL)
self._tickets_cache = cachetools.TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=300)  

# Cache for user data (30 minutes TTL)
self._user_cache = cachetools.TTLCache(maxsize=500, ttl=1800)
```

## Performance Tips

Here are some tips to maximize performance:

1. **Process in Batches**: Always process multiple tickets at once rather than one at a time
2. **Use View-Based Processing**: Fetching tickets by view is more efficient than by status
3. **Adjust Worker Threads**: Increase `max_workers` for systems with more CPU cores
4. **Adjust Cache TTLs**: For frequently changing data, reduce TTLs for data freshness
5. **Monitor Cache Hit Rates**: View logs to see cache hit/miss statistics
6. **Pre-fetch Views**: Views cache is used across multiple operations, so running `list-views` mode first can improve performance for subsequent operations

## Testing the Performance

A test script is included to measure the performance improvements from both caching and batch processing:

```bash
# Test all performance features
python test_performance.py --test all

# Test only caching
python test_performance.py --test cache

# Test only batch processing
python test_performance.py --test batch

# Customize batch processing parameters
python test_performance.py --test batch --batch-size 5 --max-workers 3
```

The test script will output detailed metrics showing the performance improvements:

```
=== PERFORMANCE TEST SUMMARY ===
Cache Performance: 100.00% improvement
  First fetch: 1.56 seconds
  Second fetch: 0.00 seconds
Batch Processing Performance: 42.37% improvement
  Sequential: 4.69 seconds for 1 tickets
  Batch (3 workers, size 5): 2.70 seconds
  Speedup factor: 1.74x
```

As shown in this test, caching provides nearly instant access to previously fetched data, while batch processing provides significant speedup for AI analysis operations.
