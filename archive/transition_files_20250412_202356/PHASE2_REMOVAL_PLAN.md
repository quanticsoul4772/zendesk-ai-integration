# Phase 2 Legacy Mode Removal Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for removing the remaining legacy components from the Zendesk AI Integration codebase, following the initial removal of the legacy CLI mode components.

## Components to Remove

The following legacy components are targeted for removal:

1. `src/modules/ai_analyzer.py`
2. `src/modules/cache_manager.py` 
3. `src/modules/db_repository.py`
4. `src/modules/report_generator.py`
5. `src/modules/reporters/` (directory)
6. `src/modules/scheduler.py`
7. `src/modules/webhook_server.py`
8. `src/modules/zendesk_client.py`
9. `src/infrastructure/utils/service_provider.py`

## Migration Plan

The migration will be executed in three stages to minimize disruption and ensure proper functionality throughout the process.

### Stage 1: Preparation

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

#### Tasks:

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Execute thorough code search to identify all references to legacy components
   - Document each reference with file location and context
   - Create a detailed dependency map showing relationships between components

2. **Dependency Mapping**
   - Create a detailed dependency graph for all legacy components
   - Determine the optimal removal order to minimize disruption
   - Identify potential circular dependencies that may require special handling

3. **Test Plan Creation**
   - Create comprehensive test scenarios for each component
   - Ensure tests cover both legacy and new implementations
   - Set up automated testing pipeline for continuous verification

4. **Compatibility Layer**
   - Design adapter classes where needed to ensure smooth transition
   - Create compatibility wrappers that use new implementations but present legacy interfaces
   - Implement feature flags to toggle between implementations if needed

### Stage 2: Implementation

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

#### Tasks:

1. **Replace ZendeskClient (`zendesk_client.py`)**
   - Identify all references to ZendeskClient
   - Create adapter that presents ZendeskClient interface but uses ZendeskRepository
   - Update references to use the adapter or ZendeskRepository directly
   - Verify all functionality works correctly

2. **Replace DBRepository (`db_repository.py`)**
   - Identify all references to DBRepository
   - Update references to use MongoDBRepository
   - Verify all database operations work correctly
   - Ensure data integrity and consistency

3. **Replace AIAnalyzer (`ai_analyzer.py`)**
   - Identify all references to AIAnalyzer
   - Update references to use appropriate AIService implementations
   - Ensure all analysis capabilities are preserved
   - Verify both standard and enhanced analysis work correctly

4. **Replace WebhookServer (`webhook_server.py`)**
   - Identify all references to WebhookServer
   - Update references to use WebhookHandler from presentation layer
   - Verify webhook functionality works correctly
   - Test integration with third-party services

5. **Replace Reporters (`reporters/` and `report_generator.py`)**
   - Identify all references to legacy reporters
   - Update references to use new reporter implementations
   - Ensure report formats remain consistent
   - Verify all report types work correctly

6. **Replace Service Provider (`utils/service_provider.py`)**
   - Identify all references to the legacy service provider
   - Update references to use the main service provider
   - Verify all services are correctly initialized and accessible

### Stage 3: Removal and Verification

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

#### Tasks:

1. **Remove Legacy Components**
   - Verify all references have been updated
   - Remove legacy components one by one
   - Execute tests after each removal
   - Ensure no dead code or unused imports remain

2. **Verify Operation**
   - Execute comprehensive test suite
   - Verify all functionality works with new components
   - Check for performance regressions
   - Ensure no unexpected side effects

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update project documentation to reflect new architecture
   - Remove references to legacy components
   - Update class diagrams and architectural documentation
   - Create migration guide for developers

4. **Final Release**
   - Update version information (v1.3.0)
   - Create release notes detailing architecture improvements
   - Tag release in version control
   - Deploy updated application

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues, the following rollback strategy will be employed:

1. Keep backups of all removed files in the `src/modules/backups` directory
2. Create Git tags at each significant stage to allow reverting to previous states
3. Maintain feature flags for critical components to allow toggling between implementations
4. Document rollback procedures for each component

## Testing Strategy

The following testing approach will be used throughout the migration:

1. **Unit Tests**: Verify individual component functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between components
3. **System Tests**: Verify end-to-end functionality
4. **Regression Tests**: Verify no existing functionality is broken
5. **Performance Tests**: Verify performance is maintained or improved

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All legacy components have been removed
2. All tests pass successfully
3. All functionality works correctly with new implementations
4. Documentation is updated to reflect new architecture
5. No performance regressions are observed
6. New version is successfully deployed
