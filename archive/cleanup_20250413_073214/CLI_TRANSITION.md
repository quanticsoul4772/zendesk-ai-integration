# CLI Transition Guide

This document tracks the transition of the Zendesk AI Integration CLI from the legacy implementation to the clean architecture implementation.

## Overview

The CLI interface is being transitioned from a monolithic legacy implementation to a modular, clean architecture implementation. This transition follows these steps:

1. **Create a command pattern framework** in the clean architecture presentation layer
2. **Update individual commands** to match the functionality of the legacy CLI
3. **Update the main CLI entry point** to use the new implementation
4. **Test and validate** the new implementation against the legacy implementation
5. **Remove legacy CLI code** once the transition is complete

## Command Pattern Implementation

The new CLI implementation follows the command pattern:

- **CommandHandler**: Manages command registration and execution
- **Command Interface**: Defines the interface for all commands
- **Command Implementations**: Implement the command interface for specific actions

## Progress Tracker

| Command | Legacy Functionality | Clean Architecture Implementation | Status |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------------------|--------|
| Analyze Ticket | Analyze a specific ticket or all tickets in a view | AnalyzeTicketCommand | ✅ Complete |
| List Views | List all available Zendesk views | ListViewsCommand | ✅ Complete |
| Generate Report | Generate various reports based on ticket analysis | GenerateReportCommand | ✅ Complete |
| Interactive Mode | Launch an interactive menu interface | InteractiveCommand | ✅ Complete |
| Webhook Server | Start a webhook server for real-time analysis | WebhookCommand | ✅ Complete |
| Schedule | Set up scheduled analysis jobs | ScheduleCommand | ✅ Complete |

## Key Improvements in Clean Architecture Implementation

1. **Better argument handling**:
   - More consistent argument naming
   - Improved help messages
   - Proper handling of all error cases

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easier testing and maintenance
   - Explicit dependencies for each command

3. **Error Handling**:
   - More comprehensive error handling
   - Better error messages for users
   - Proper logging of exceptions

4. **Command Structure**:
   - More consistent command structure
   - Clearer command organization
   - Better help documentation

## Testing

All commands should be tested to ensure they match the functionality of the legacy implementation:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual command classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test commands with their dependencies
3. **Manual Validation**: Test the CLI in real-world scenarios

## Completion Criteria

The CLI transition is considered complete when:

1. All commands have been implemented in the clean architecture
2. All functionality from the legacy CLI is available in the new implementation
3. All tests pass
4. The CLI can be used without any references to legacy code

## Removal of Legacy CLI Code

Once the transition is complete, the following legacy files can be removed:

- `src/modules/cli.py`
- `src/modules/menu/*` (directory with menu implementation)

## Next Steps

1. Complete implementation of all command classes
2. Add unit tests for all commands
3. Update the documentation to reflect the new CLI structure
4. Test the CLI with real-world scenarios
5. Remove legacy CLI code

## Notes for Developers

- Follow the command pattern when implementing new commands
- Use dependency injection for all services and repositories
- Provide helpful error messages for users
- Document all command arguments and options
- Test both success and failure scenarios
